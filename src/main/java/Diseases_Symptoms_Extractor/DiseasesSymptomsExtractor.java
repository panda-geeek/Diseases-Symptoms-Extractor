				+ " A heart attack usually occurs when a blood clot blocks blood flow to the heart. Sometime nausea is the reason for heart attack."
				+ " Fourth one is Heart valve disease. Heart valve disease occurs when one or more of the heart valves malfunction."
				+ " The main symptom of heart valve disease is an unusual heartbeat sound known as the heart murmur. "
